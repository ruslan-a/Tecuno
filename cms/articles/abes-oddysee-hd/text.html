<p>Just Add Water, the studio responsible for the HD rerelease of Stranger's Wrath has announced their next Oddworld rerelease, the original Abe's Oddysee. From the screenshots and videos we've seen so far, it looks great, with the entire game rendered in 3D, crisp textures, and even some interesting yet subtle perspective camera effects. It's scheduled to be released in Q4 2013, so there's still quite a wait, but it comes with the hope that they'll do it right</p>
