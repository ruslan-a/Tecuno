<p>With the still recent launch of iOS6, there are many users who have yet to update to the new operating system for the highly popular Apple devices. And as with any new update, there have been numerous complaints from users after upgrading, perhaps the most publicised being the less detailed Maps. One that hasn't had anywhere near as much publicity however is a problem that some users are stating that when updating to the new iOS, their contacts were wiped from their phone, even after restoring the rest of the device's settings as is the norm after iOS upgrades.</p>
<p>Many technical users and even Apple Advisors themselves have been dismissing the blame for the data loss as merely a standard issue that occurs during any major wipe and redesign of the software on the phone, but clearly data loss of this scope isn't something to be ignored like this. During the standard upgrade procedure for iOS 6, that is, through iTunes, it recommends that the user backs up their device to either iCloud or iTunes on a local computer. However since the recent addition of over the air (OTA) upgrades, that don't require iTunes or a computer, a backup prompt no longer appears, leaving any customer who just hits the "update" button left without any security of their content. While it is a bit shameful for Apple to leave the most common way to update barred of any warnings, it is still in their ToS and Agreement when you update the iOS that any data loss is not their responsibility.</p>
<p>That may have changed now though, as reported by a technical advisor in AppleCare there has been brought to the attention of the staff a known problem with the iOS6 update when activating iCloud. After the user has updated to iOS6 they are prompted to start using iCloud to backup their contacts/calendars/etc. The irony in this though is that turning on iCloud at this point is actually the reason that it wipes the contacts already on the phone and replaces them with the ones on iCloud. No issue for those who already use iCloud, but to anyone who is new to the service, the contents of their iCloud contacts would be empty, resulting in their full address book being replaced by absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>There is no word on whether Apple is working on a fix at this point in time, but it is clear that anyone who has used this method to activate iCloud will be at risk of losing their contacts. The current recommendation by AppleCare is to NOT turn on iCloud while completing the iOS6 setup and turn it on once they are in the iPhone regularly. Also it is a good idea to use a sync service such as Google Contacts to ensure data loss never happens, or even to move your contacts over to iCloud through the web interface or a Mac before updating to iOS 6.</p>
