<p>With the Mists of Pandaria expansion just released there is much hype and interest back in the World of Warcraft scene of MMO gaming. Coming back from a three month leave after clearing all of Cataclysm I am very excited to be able to take a look and have a play with the new race (Pandarian), class (Monk), and the new zones in Azeroth. Remember these are just my first impressions and do not reflect the longevity of the expansion or the end game content!</p>
<p>Being the second expansion blizzard has released as both a physical and virtual release, many players chose to turn to buying it online to gain instant access into the new vast of Pandaria. Due to these instant access players the servers over at blizzard were under heavy assault from their players. Resulting in many disconnects, crashes and some very frustrated server first level 90 contenders.</p>
<p>When finally into the game, the new character creation screen that came with the 5.0 update creates a welcoming experience to new players and a refurbished and convenient one for old players.
Being held up at work on the launch evening stopped me from getting too into the gameplay, but I was able to complete the starting zone for the Panda race and am so far very pleased with Blizzard's work this time around.</p>
<p>Diving into Pandaria via the new starting zone leaves players hit with a wave of absolutely stunning visuals and atmosphere setting music. From the leaves falling from the old pink trees and the monks panting and grunting as they train to the architect and detail going into the beautiful asian themed buildings and surroundings blizzard has not left a stone unturned.
The new levelling experience that come with the starting zone is enough to keep the oldest players entertained with some light hearted humour and some interactive mechanics for each quest. Once the initial new expansion ecstasy wears off the story of the Pandarian race is in-depth to keep you on your toes till the end where you make the ultimate decision of Horde, or Alliance to push you back into the "real" world of the Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor.</p>
