<p>In starting this tech site, and having no prior experience in writing, I quickly found that my code editors of choice simply didn't cut it for writing. Of course I could have simply used TextEdit or Word but I decided to look for something better suited to the task.</p>
<p>Looking at the Mac App Store, my choices seemed to be between only a handful of similar apps, and I ended up deciding on iA Writer for its relative maturity and iCloud integration. iA Writer was also the one that I recall commonly mentioned around the Twittersphere and among my friends, plus it was on sale for half price, and who can resist that?</p>
<p>And so after another small blow to the plastic, I was one app icon richer, and 5 dollars poorer. Upon first launching iA Writer, I assume I would have been treated to the changelog/tutorial introductory document that appeared later, however something had compelled me to run the program for the first time by opening an existing file. Not a catastrophe by any means but to a stickler for presentation, it did bug me some in hindsight.</p>
<p>Either way I was presented with the main application window, filled with my existing text file. </p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was the unique layout, which seems to be a feature of most of these 'distraction free writers'. The text was large, at a guess maybe 20pt, in a nice clean monospaced font. I wouldn't normally consider doing anything but coding in a font like this, but iA has chosen quite a nice variant, and combined with the large size, it gives quite a charming impression of a typewriter. I had seen many complaints about the font size being too large, and perhaps it's the slightly higher than average DPI on my screen, but it seems great to me, the extra size making it much easier to focus on what I'm writing without being comically large.</p>

<p>The actual layout of the text, favouring whitespace and an optimised column width is one of my favourite things about iA as opposed to standard text editors. While you can set a column width yourself in the likes of Sublime Text, it's not as elegant as it is here, where it's set in stone and not something you need ever think about.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what this app is about, the lack of options, the large text, the insanely minimal UI, they all aim to put the text at the forefront, and in my opinion, it works great. </p>
<p>On that note, I should talk about Focus Mode, the most obvious UI feature of the app, which is saying something, as it's a small unassuming switch in the lower left corner of the app.</p>
<p>What Focus Mode claims to do is to hide everything but the sentence you're typing, to allow you to focus on one thought at a time and discourage the distractions that come from your own writing such as cross-editing. How it achieves this is by simply fading out the rest of the text before and after the sentence you're on, allowing you to still read the text, but it makes the current sentence prominent enough to work exactly as advertised. Especially in the wee hours of the night when my brain is racing and I really ought to be asleep, I've found this feature to be a godsend, without it I simply don't have the willpower or brainpower to write any sort of coherent piece. </p>

<p>iA writer also supports inline markdown, formatting the text as you type, which is a great feature and works as expected. It saves to any plaintext file type that you can open with a text editor, and supports iCloud, for transferring files between the Mac and iOS versions. There is also an Export option that can output RTF and HTML files, and I assumed this would be useful for generating HTML output of my markdown syntax, but instead it creates a complete HTML document, complete with its own set of styles and tags, which in my opinion is totally useless unless you want to publish a site with their rigid style and settings.</p>
<p>Mercifully though, there is an option to 'Copy HTML' which does what I thought it would, and merely converts your markdown syntax to HTML. I feel this is a slightly clunky solution however since I need to create a new file to paste it in, but it makes a whole lot of sense when publishing to a blogging platform with inline HTML, or pasting into an existing page's source code. </p>
<p>Despite these slight confusions, everything else iA Writer sets out to do, it does well. It succeeds in putting focus on your writing and nothing but, markdown support is cleverly integrated, the font is beautiful, and while it may be too big on some screens, it manages to strike a good balance for me, and iCloud integration is definitely nice for quick edits on an iPhone or a half-completed article on an iPad. It was definitely worth the discounted price of $5, but I wouldn't hesitated to drop the full $10, considering the productivity increase it gained me.</p>
