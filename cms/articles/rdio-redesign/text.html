This is the sample site for the Tecuno CMS. It's running a live version of the system, you can see the backend by going to <a href="sample.tecunocms.com/cms">sample.tecunocms.com/cms</a> and logging in with any value - for the demonstration it'll accept whatever you type, a really installed version however will obviously be running a secure backend.
