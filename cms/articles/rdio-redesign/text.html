<p>The iOS version Rdio app has just been updated to version 2.0.0 bringing a complete UI overhaul and several interesting features. The graphical upgrade was long overdue with the previous versions using modifications of the ancient standard shiny iOS elements, which the OS itself has been moving away from recently, everything's been given a very flat and dare I say metro-like look.</p>

<p>The main navigation has ditched the old grid of icons reminiscent of early Facebook apps in favour of the slide out navigation list, reminiscent of the latest Facebook app, that's not to say they're ripping it off per-s√© as it's become a staple of iOS UI design with many apps having already appropriated it.</p>

<p>Along with the graphical changes Rdio has added remote control and unified player functionality which purportedly allows the user to control Rdio's playback on any other device it's running on which may be quite useful for those connected to stereo systems or the like, I personally haven't been able to test it but early reports say it works fine.</p>
