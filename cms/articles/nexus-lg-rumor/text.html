<p>It looks like some details have been leaked about the latest Nexus device. According to MoDaCo's founder, Paul O'Brien, the next Nexus phone will be released in November and announced towards the end of this month. It's rumoured to be manufactured by LG, with hardware based on their current flagship, the Optimus G. The specs purportedly feature a 1280x768 resolution, on, at a guess, a 4.7" screen, with a quad-core Snapdragon S4 processor and 2GB of RAM. </p>
<p>Several sources also claim inductive charging will be the phone's standout feature, something which no other Nexus device has had in past. </p>
<p>The timing of this rumoured announcement seems largely correct, coming almost exactly a year after 2011's Galaxy Nexus. It remains to be seen whether this specific rumour holds truth, but it is apparently a 'trusted source'. Regardless it will be interesting to see what the first non-Samsung Nexus phone in two generations will have in store. </p>
