<p>With Telstra having the exclusive on the initial release of the new Lumia 920s and 820s from Nokia, you can understand why people have been itching to hear a bit more about when they're going to be released.</p>
<p>Telstra have let on about their planned pricing on the devices for around a month now but there was no information till earlier today when it was announced that the device would go on sale from Tuesday the 27th of November. Along with this, the device is now available for preorder on their website with any order before the 20th of November receiving a free JBL PlayUp speaker (valued at $199).<p>
<p>The speaker is both bluetooth and NFC compatible so users will be able to test out one of the biggest selling point of the device, its NFC chip. Whether there is much use for it beyond charging and media is unknown as Australian banks are yet to roll out NFC compatible banking applications that will allow you to replace your PayPass card with the phone.</p>
<p>Only a couple more weeks to go folks! I definitely plan on picking one of these up and will be doing a full rundown, first look and unboxing of the device as I pick it up. Stick around to keep posted on the latest on the new Nokia Lumia 920 and 820 smart phones.</p>
