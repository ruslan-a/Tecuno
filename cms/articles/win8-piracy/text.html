<p>As with Windows 7, Vista before it, and XP before that, pirates have taken to the unlocking of their plundered booty from the leak of the final copy of Windows 8 in early August. While still attempting to find a complete work around for the activation policy have been unfruitful, pirates attempting to crack the policy managed to bundle together a system that allowed users of a pirated copy of Windows 8 to activate a copy for 180 days, needing a new activation every six months.</p>
<p>But it seems Microsoft has paved the way for these digital plunderers to their booty by accident. Microsoft is currently giving away a Media Center upgrade to installs of Windows 8 Pro until January 31st 2013. Where they fell short on this plan was that any user who activated their pirated copy of Windows 8 using the 180 activation system just needs to punch in the key provided for the upgrade to allow their system to become fully equipped for good up to a full retail version supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to comment on the situation at hand and are eagerly awaited for their response to the give away.</p>
