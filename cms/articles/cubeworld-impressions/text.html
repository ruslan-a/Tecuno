<p>Cube World is a voxel based action RPG with an amazingly large amount of hype from the indie community. Currently in development by a team of two, the head developer and creator of the game is named Wollay and has an extensive blog dedicated to the game over at http://wollay.blogspot.com.</p>
<p>While the game has yet to see a public release of the current or any previous builds, there are about eight videos on the dev's YouTube channel that depict a lot of the gameplay. In short the game looks like a a cross between Super Mario 64 and Minecraft, with JRPG-esque elements.</p>
<p>From the videos and screen shots of the game we can see why there's such a huge group of followers waiting for the game to go live - the voxel worlds and characters are simple yet stunning with their use of bold colour and cute characteristics. The audio currently in place is very immersive in what would be best described as a fantasy story world from a children's novel.</p>
<p>The vast array of mobs and animals, from humans to dragons, to giant turtle monsters that look like bowser, make the pre beta world look already filled to the brim. Fighting these mobs also seems pretty solidly build using a system of combo point style "spirit" to unleash execution moves and built in combo strikes using an array of weapons such as bows, two handed weapons and dual wieldable axes and swords. Combat looks very lively through the use of barrel roll blocks, dodging, flips and jumps to evade and execute different attacks. There are also animations for world interaction such as deaths and the destruction of the world from explosions or boss fights. Players are given the ability to customise the appearance of their weapons using a simple in game design tool.</p>
<p>The end objective of the game is unclear at this point but from the videos show quest givers, NPC towns and castles and boss style dragons who can destroy parts of the world with their attacks.</p>
<p>From what I've seen of the game so far it appears that players will receive an arcade version style of Minecraft minus the gathering and mining. I have high hopes for this RPG as Minecraft was a favourite of mine. We'll keep you posted on any progress and there may be a video up soon!</p>
